# Apps-Script-Battleship-Self-Server
This is the dumbest way possible to manage a multiplayer game, but I did it just by using only the slowest and possibly worst combination of apps script and google sheets combined to make a database using gamecodes and joing lobbies you can share with friends and possibly stream, It might be too slow to stream it to be fair because it's really not that interesting besides using the dumbest way possible to set up a project.

You may ask... Why? Why appscript and google sheets? Well, since I created it on my school account this is the only way I could start it, yes I could use SQL and learn it because it seems cool to learn and way better but for now let's stick with doing this the dumbest way possible for compatability with schools that use appscript and don't have it blocked.

Either way this was mostly made because I felt like it, someone thought it was a dumb idea and that I coulden't do it, which is correct in java bacause oh my it's difficult finding something that I can make a multiplayer game just using java so I just went to the casual javascript and html basis because it was easy to learn even though i'm still learning.

This program is going into a Tech Fest and will be provided for everyone shortly because, well, who wants to look at terrible code on a terrible platform...? I think it's currently you especially since you read this far. You can go into the instructions and get started on how to set up the code once downloaded or interested in reading an setting a self-server up. It's easy and compatable but there are deffinently better method and codes. There might be more code than there needs but it's like my rough draft and I didn't feel like going through everything.

Therefor the best gamecode to possibly get is W6969

[WARNING: THIS CODE IS TERRIBLE AND CURRENTLY DOSEN"T HAVE INSTRUCTIONS, IT"S NOT SUPER EASY TO SETUP]
